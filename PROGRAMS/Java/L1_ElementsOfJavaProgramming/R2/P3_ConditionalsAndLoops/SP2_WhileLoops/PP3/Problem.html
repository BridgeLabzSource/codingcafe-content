<h1><a id="Practise_Program_3_0"></a>Practise Program 3</h1>
<p>Write a program Binary.java prints the binary (base 2) representation of the decimal number typed as the command-line argument. It is based on decomposing the number into a sum of powers of 2. For example, the binary representation of 106 is 11010102, which is the same as saying that 106 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 2. Ensure necessary padding to represent 4 Byte String.</p>
<p>To compute the binary representation of n, we consider the powers of 2 less than or equal to n in decreasing order to determine which belong in the binary decomposition (and therefore correspond to a 1 bit in the binary representation).</p>
