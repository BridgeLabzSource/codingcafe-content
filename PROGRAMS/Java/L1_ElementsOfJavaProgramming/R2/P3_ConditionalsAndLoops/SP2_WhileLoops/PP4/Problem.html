<p>Extend Binary.java to read an integer as an Input, convert to Binary and perform the following functions.<br>
i. Swap nibbles and find the new number.<br>
ii. Find the resultant number is the number is a power of 2.<br>
A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet. There are two nibbles in a byte.<br>
Given a byte, swap the two nibbles in it. For example 100 is to be represented as 01100100 in a byte (or 8 bits). The two nibbles are (0110) and (0100). If we swap the two nibbles, we get 01000110 which is 70 in decimal.</p>
