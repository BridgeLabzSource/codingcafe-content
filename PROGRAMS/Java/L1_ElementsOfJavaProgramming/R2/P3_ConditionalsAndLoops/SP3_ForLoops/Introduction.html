<h1><a id="For_loops_0"></a>For loops</h1>
<p>The for loop is an alternate Java construct that allows us even more flexibility when writing loops.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For notation</strong>. Many loops follow the same basic scheme: initialize an index variable to some value and then use a <code>while loop</code> to test an exit condition involving the index variable, using the last statement in the <code>while loop</code> to modify the index variable. Javaâ€™s <code>for loop</code> is a direct way to express such loops.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Compound assignment idioms</strong>. The idiom <code>i++</code> is a shorthand notation for <code>i = i + 1.</code></li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>. The scope of a variable is the part of the program that can refer to that variable by name. Generally the scope of a variable comprises the statements that follow the declaration in the same block as the declaration. For this purpose, the code in the <code>for loop</code> header is considered to be in the same block as the <code>for loop</code> body.</li>
</ul>
