<h1><a id="Nesting_0"></a>Nesting</h1>
<p>The <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code> statements have the same status as assignment statements or any other statements in Java; that is, we can use them wherever a statement is called for. In particular, we can use one or more of them in the body of another statement to make compound statements. To emphasize the nesting, we use indentation in the program code.</p>
