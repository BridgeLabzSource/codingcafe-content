<h1><a id="Programming_in_Java_0"></a>Programming in Java</h1>
<p>We break the process of programming in Java into three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the program by typing it into a text editor and saving it to a file named, say, <code>MyProgram.java</code>.</li>
<li>Compile it by typing <code>&quot;javac MyProgram.java&quot;</code> in the terminal window.</li>
<li>Execute (or run) it by typing <code>&quot;java MyProgram&quot;</code> in the terminal window.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step creates the program; the second translates it into a language more suitable for machine execution (and puts the result in a file named <code>MyProgram.class</code>); the third actually runs the program.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a Java program</strong>. A program is nothing more than a sequence of characters, like a sentence, a paragraph, or a poem. To create one, we need only define that sequence characters using a text editor in the same way as we do for email.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sh">public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints <span class="hljs-string">"Hello, World"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the terminal window.
      System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello, World"</span>);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compiling a Java program</strong>. A compiler is an application that translates programs from the Java language to a language more suitable for executing on the computer. It takes a text file with the <code>.java</code> extension as input (your program) and produces a file with a <code>.class</code> extension (the computer-language version).&lt;br&gt;<br>
To compile <code>HelloWorld.java</code> type the boldfaced text below at the terminal. (We use the % symbol to denote the command prompt, but it may appear different depending on your system.)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sh">% javac HelloWorld.java
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Executing (or running) a Java program</strong>. Once you compile your program, you can execute it. This is the exciting part, where the computer follows your instructions. To run the <code>HelloWorld</code> program, type the following in the terminal window:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sh">% java HelloWorld
</code></pre>
<p>If all goes well, you should see the following response,</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Hello, World
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding a Java program</strong>. The key line with System.out.println() prints the text “Hello, World” in the terminal window. When we begin to write more complicated programs, we will discuss the meaning of <code>public, class, main, String[], args, System.out</code>, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Creating your own Java program</strong>. For the time being, all of our programs will be just like HelloWorld.java, except with a different sequence of statements in <code>main()</code>. The easiest way to write such a program is to:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Copy <code>HelloWorld.java</code>into a new file whose name is the program name followed by .java.</li>
<li>Replace <code>HelloWorld</code>with the program name everywhere.</li>
<li>Replace the print statement by a sequence of statements.</li>
</ol>
