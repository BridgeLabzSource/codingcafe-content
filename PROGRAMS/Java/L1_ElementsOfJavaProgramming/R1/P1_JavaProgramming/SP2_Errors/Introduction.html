<h1><a id="Errors_0"></a>Errors</h1>
<p>Most errors are easily fixed by carefully examining the program as we create it, in just the same way as we fix spelling and grammatical errors when we type an e-mail message.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compile-time errors</strong>. These errors are caught by the system when we compile the program, because they prevent the compiler from doing the translation (so it issues an error message that tries to explain why).</li>
<li><strong>Run-time errors</strong>. These errors are caught by the system when we execute the program, because the program tries to perform an invalid operation (e.g., division by zero).</li>
<li><strong>Logical errors</strong>. These errors are (hopefully) caught by the programmer when we execute the program and it produces the wrong answer. Bugs are the bane of a programmerâ€™s existence. They can be subtle and very hard to find.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the very first skills that you will learn is to identify errors; one of the next will be to be sufficiently careful when coding to avoid many of them.</p>
