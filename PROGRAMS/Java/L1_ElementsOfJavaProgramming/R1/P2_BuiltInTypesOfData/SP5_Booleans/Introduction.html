<h1><a id="Booleans_0"></a>Booleans</h1>
<p>The boolean type has just two values: true or false. The apparent simplicity is deceivingâ€”booleans lie at the foundation of computer science. The most important operators defined for the boolean are for and, or, and not.</p>
<ul>
<li>and:  a &amp;&amp; b is true if both a and b are true, and false otherwise.</li>
<li>or:  a || b is true if either a or b is true (or both are true), and false otherwise</li>
<li>not:  !a is true if a is false, and false otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these definitions are intuitive and easy to understand, it is worthwhile to fully specify each possibility for each operation in a truth table.</p>
