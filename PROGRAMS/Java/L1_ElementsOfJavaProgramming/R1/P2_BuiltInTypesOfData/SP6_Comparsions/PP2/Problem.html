<h1><a id="Practice_Problem_2_0"></a>Practice Problem 2</h1>
<p>Write a program DayOfWeek.java that takes a date as input and prints the day of the week that date falls on. Your program should take three command-line arguments: m (month), d (day), and y (year). For m use 1 for January, 2 for February, and so forth. For output print 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so forth. Use the following formulas, for the Gregorian calendar (where / denotes integer division):<br>
y0 = y − (14 − m) / 12<br>
x = y0 + y0/4 − y0/100 + y0/400<br>
m0 = m + 12 × ((14 − m) / 12) − 2<br>
d0 = (d + x + 31m0 / 12) mod 7</p>
