<p>Write a LeapYear.java program that takes a year as input and outputs the Year is a Leap Year or not a Leap Year.<br>
The LeapYear program only works for year &gt;= 1582, corresponding to a year in the Gregorian calendar. So ensure to check for the same. Further the Leap Year is a Year divisible by 4 and not 100 unless it is divisible by 400. For e.g. 1800 is not a Leap Year and 2000 is a Leap Year.</p>
