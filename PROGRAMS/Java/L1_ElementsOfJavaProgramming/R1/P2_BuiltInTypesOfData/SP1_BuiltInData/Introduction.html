<p>A data type is a set of values and a set of operations defined on them. For example, we are familiar with numbers and with operations defined on them such as addition and multiplication. There are eight different built-in types of data in Java, mostly different kinds of numbers. We use the system type for strings of characters so frequently that we also consider it here.</p>

<p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>
<p>We use the following code fragment to introduce some terminology:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">int a, b, c;
a = <span class="hljs-number">1234</span>;
b = <span class="hljs-number">99</span>;
c = a + b;
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is a declaration statement that declares the names of three variables using the identifiers a, b, and c and their type to be int. The next three lines are assignment statements that change the values of the variables, using the literals 1234 and 99, and the expression a + b, with the end result that c has the value 1333.</p>
