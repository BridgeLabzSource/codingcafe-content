<h1><a id="Type_conversion_0"></a>Type conversion</h1>
<p>We often find ourselves converting data from one type to another using one of the following approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit type conversion</strong>. Call methods such as <code>Math.round(), Integer.parseInt(), and Double.parseDouble()</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic type conversion</strong>. For primitive numeric types, the system automatically performs type conversion when we use a value whose type has a larger range of values than expected.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit casts</strong>. Java also has some built-in type conversion methods for primitive types that you can use when you are aware that you might lose information, but you have to make your intention using something called a cast.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic conversions for strings</strong>. The built-in type String obeys special rules. One of these special rules is that you can easily convert any type of data to a String by using the + operator.</li>
</ul>
